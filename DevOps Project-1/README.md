# Automated Web Development Environment

![](images/Jenkins-Github-Server.png)

Directory "Website" consists of all the files of the Website that I used for creating a Web Development Environment by interating Git/Github, Jenkins and apache Web Server in Redhat 8. I have written a well documented article in my LinkedIn Handle explaining how we can create an web development environment using these technologies. . Also I have attached some of my YouTube videos in the article for better understanding of the installation and setting up the environment for the automation.
